//! HTTP serving layer for the Hephaestus unified ONNX inference runtime.
//!
//! This crate provides the REST API surface, health probes,
//! graceful shutdown, and error mapping for Hephaestus.
//! Handlers access the inference pipeline through shared [`AppState`]
//! and the router is constructed via [`build_router`].
